## 1. Project Name
**WAlphaHunter: The Validated AI Trading Engine**

## 2. Tagline (Max 120 chars)
Research-grade AI trading system with on-chain "Proof-of-Trading" logs and WXT-optimized fee logic.

## 3. Short Description (Max 300 chars)
WAlphaHunter brings institutional rigor to the WEEX ecosystem. Features a hybrid Polars/TypeScript engine, Monte Carlo risk validation, and a unique "Trading Proof-of-Work" system that anchors every AI decision to a hash on Base Sepolia.

## 4. Full Description
### The Problem: AI "Black Boxes"
Most AI trading bots are opaque. Users must trust that an AI actually made the decision rather than a simple hardcoded script. In the WEEX Alpha Awakens context, proving *intelligence* is key.

### The Solution: WAlphaHunter
WAlphaHunter is a transparent, high-performance trading architecture designed specifically for WEEX futures pairs.

#### Key Innovations:
1.  **AI Audit Trail:** Every signal generated by our Gemini 2.5 adapter is hashed and logged. We map `TradeID -> AI DecisionID -> OnChain Hash`.
2.  **WXT Fee Optimization:** The engine natively models the WXT token discount (50% off), drastically altering the PnL calculus for high-frequency strategies.
3.  **Hybrid Architecture:** 
    - **Python (Polars):** for heavy feature engineering (Macd, RSI, Volatility).
    - **TypeScript (Node 20):** for deterministic execution and API compliance.
4.  **Monte Carlo validated:** We don't just backtest; we stress-test. Our probability engine runs 10,000 permutations to ensure the strategy survives market shocks.

### How it uses WEEX
We integrate with the WEEX Futures Pro API (simulated in BUIDL phase via `engine-compliance`). The system is pre-configured to trade `BTC/USDT` and `ETH/USDT` using the specific "WXT Holder" fee tier (0.03% Taker).
